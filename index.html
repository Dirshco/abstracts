    <h3>Proposed Title</h3>
    <p><b>Effectiveness of Telemedicine in Nursing Homes and Post-Acute Care: A Systematic Review of Clinical Outcomes and Healthcare Utilisation</b></p>

    <h3>Abstract Draft (Editable)</h3>
    <div class="abstract">
Background:
Residents in nursing homes and post-acute care facilities have high rates of emergency department transfers and hospital admissions.
Telemedicine has expanded rapidly, but its clinical effectiveness in long-term care remains unclear. This systematic review aimed to
evaluate the impact of telemedicine interventions on acute care utilisation and patient outcomes in nursing home populations.

Methods:
A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidance. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were searched
from inception to [Month Year]. Eligible studies evaluated telemedicine interventions in nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities,
or long-term care settings. Outcomes included hospital admissions, ED transfers, mortality, patient satisfaction, staff satisfaction,
and cost. Study quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or Cochrane risk-of-bias tools.

Results:
XX studies including approximately XX,XXX residents were included. Telemedicine models included video consultations, tele-geriatric
programs, remote monitoring, and urgent tele-triage. Most studies reported reductions in ED transfers and hospital admissions,
particularly when integrated with escalation protocols. Evidence for mortality benefit was inconsistent. Several studies reported
high satisfaction among staff and families and potential cost savings. Implementation barriers included staff training needs,
connectivity issues, and inconsistent clinician engagement.

Conclusion:
Telemedicine may reduce acute care utilisation and improve access to timely clinical decision-making in nursing homes.
Future research should focus on standardised outcome reporting, cost-effectiveness analysis, and patient-centred outcomes
to guide scalable implementation.

    <h3>Proposed Title</h3>
    <p><b>Artificial Intelligence Clinical Documentation Tools in Healthcare: A Scoping Review of Efficiency Gains, Patient Safety Risks, and Implementation Barriers</b></p>

    <h3>Abstract Draft (Editable)</h3>
    <div class="abstract">
Background:
AI-driven clinical documentation tools, including ambient scribes and automated note-generation systems, are increasingly used to
reduce administrative burden. While early evidence suggests improved workflow efficiency, concerns remain regarding patient safety,
documentation accuracy, bias, privacy, and medico-legal accountability. This scoping review aimed to summarise current evidence on
AI documentation tools in clinical practice.

Methods:
A scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidance. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched
from inception to [Month Year]. Studies were included if they evaluated AI-based documentation tools used in clinical workflows
(real-world or simulated). Data extracted included clinical setting, tool type, outcomes (time saved, note quality, error rates),
patient safety concerns, clinician satisfaction, and implementation barriers.

Results:
XX studies were included. Most were observational pilot studies conducted in outpatient and emergency department settings.
Reported benefits included reduced documentation time and improved clinician satisfaction. Patient safety concerns included
inaccurate transcription, omission of key details, inappropriate insertion of information, and unclear accountability for errors.
Data privacy, patient consent, and EMR integration challenges were frequently reported. Evidence quality was limited by small sample
sizes and short follow-up periods.

Conclusion:
AI documentation tools may improve efficiency but raise important safety and governance concerns. Robust prospective studies with
standardised safety outcomes (hallucination rates, omission errors, downstream harm) are needed before widespread adoption.

    <p><b>Hyperkalemia in Acute Kidney Injury Secondary to Obstructive Uropathy: A Systematic Review of Predictors, Management Strategies, and Outcomes</b></p>

    <h3>Abstract Draft (Editable)</h3>
    <div class="abstract">
Background:
Obstructive uropathy is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and may result in life-threatening hyperkalemia.
Although relief of obstruction is the definitive management, predictors and outcomes of hyperkalemia in this setting remain
poorly characterised. This systematic review aimed to evaluate predictors of hyperkalemia and associated clinical outcomes in
patients with obstructive uropathy-associated AKI.

Methods:
A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidance. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched
from inception to [Month Year]. Studies reporting adult patients with obstructive uropathy-related AKI and hyperkalemia incidence
or outcomes were included. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Results:
XX studies including X,XXX patients were included. Hyperkalemia incidence varied widely. Predictors included bilateral hydronephrosis,
oliguria/anuria, prolonged obstruction, and baseline chronic kidney disease. Severe hyperkalemia was associated with increased ICU
admission and dialysis requirement. Relief of obstruction through catheterisation or nephrostomy was associated with improved potassium
and renal recovery, though post-obstructive diuresis and electrolyte instability were common.

Conclusion:
Hyperkalemia is a clinically significant complication of obstructive AKI and is associated with higher rates of ICU admission and dialysis.
Early recognition and urgent decompression may improve outcomes. Prospective studies are needed to standardise risk stratification
and management pathways.

    <h3>Proposed Title</h3>
    <p><b>Interventions to Reduce 30-Day Hospital Readmissions from Skilled Nursing Facilities: A Systematic Review of Transitional Care and Quality Improvement Models</b></p>

    <h3>Abstract Draft (Editable)</h3>
    <div class="abstract">
Background:
Hospital readmissions from skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and post-acute care settings contribute significantly to healthcare
costs and patient morbidity. Many readmissions are potentially preventable through improved transitional care, medication
reconciliation, and early clinical reassessment. This systematic review evaluated interventions aimed at reducing hospital
readmissions from SNFs and nursing homes.

Methods:
A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidance. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were searched
from inception to [Month Year]. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions in SNFs or long-term care settings and reported
outcomes including 30-day readmission rates, ED transfers, mortality, or cost. Study quality was assessed using Cochrane risk-of-bias
tools or Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Due to heterogeneity, results were synthesised narratively.

Results:
XX studies including XX,XXX residents were included. Interventions included transitional care programs, structured hospital-to-SNF
communication tools, pharmacist-led medication reconciliation, early warning nursing protocols, and telemedicine physician support.
Most studies reported reductions in readmission rates, especially when interventions combined medication review with early follow-up.
Barriers included staffing limitations and inconsistent protocol adoption.

Conclusion:
Multidisciplinary transitional care interventions may reduce readmissions from SNFs. Workforce capacity and structured communication
systems appear critical for success. Further high-quality studies are needed to identify scalable and cost-effective strategies.

    <h3>Proposed Title</h3>
    <p><b>Educational Strategies for Teaching Clinical Reasoning to International Medical Graduates: A Scoping Review</b></p>

    <h3>Abstract Draft (Editable)</h3>
    <div class="abstract">
Background:
International medical graduates (IMGs) represent a critical component of the healthcare workforce in both the UK and US.
Despite clinical competence, many IMGs face challenges adapting to local healthcare systems, communication standards, and
clinical reasoning expectations. This scoping review aimed to identify educational strategies used to teach clinical reasoning
and professional integration skills to IMGs and internationally trained physicians.

Methods:
A scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidance. PubMed/MEDLINE, ERIC, Scopus, and Embase were searched from inception
to [Month Year]. Studies were included if they evaluated educational interventions for IMGs or internationally trained physicians
targeting clinical reasoning, diagnostic accuracy, communication, or professionalism. Data were extracted on intervention type,
duration, outcomes, and assessment methods.

Results:
XX studies were included. Interventions included case-based learning, simulation training, structured mentorship programs,
OSCE coaching, communication workshops, and e-learning modules. Many studies reported improved exam performance and increased
confidence, though objective clinical reasoning assessment methods varied. Successful programs commonly included longitudinal
mentorship and feedback-based learning. Barriers included time constraints, faculty availability, and inconsistent standardisation
of competency assessment.

Conclusion:
Educational interventions for IMGs appear beneficial, particularly those incorporating mentorship and structured simulation-based
training. More rigorous studies using validated clinical reasoning and patient safety outcomes are needed to guide scalable program
design for workforce integration.

      <b>Strong Poster Strategy for IMGs:</b>
      Use 1 clean figure + 1 summary table + PRISMA flow.
      Judges love clarity more than complexity.

    <h2 class="section-title">How IMGs Can Turn These Into Career-Boosting Publications</h2>

    <p>
      These projects are designed not only for abstract submission, but also for conversion into
      a full manuscript for journals such as <b>Future Healthcare Journal</b> or <b>ClinMed</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommended Roles for IMG Teams (2–5 people)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Lead Author:</b> research question + writing</li>
      <li><b>Screening Lead:</b> abstracts + inclusion/exclusion</li>
      <li><b>Extraction Lead:</b> builds spreadsheet and extracts results</li>
      <li><b>Methods Lead:</b> PRISMA, bias scoring, citations</li>
      <li><b>Senior Reviewer/Mentor:</b> clinical interpretation and final polish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Practices to Avoid Rejection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do NOT include author names in the abstract text.</li>
      <li>Keep within 500 words.</li>
      <li>Use clear structured headings: Background / Methods / Results / Conclusion.</li>
      <li>Include at least 1–2 numbers in Results (XX studies, XX participants).</li>
      <li>Always include limitations.</li>
    </ul>
